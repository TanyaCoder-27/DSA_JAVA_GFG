Equal point in a string of brackets
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 40.8%Submissions: 20K+Points: 2
Given a string str of opening and closing brackets '(' and ')' only. The task is to find an equal point. An equal point is an index (0-based) such that the number of closing brackets on the right from that point must be equal to the number of opening brackets before that point.

Examples:

Input: str = "(())))("
Output: 4
Explanation: After index 4, string splits into (())) and )(. Number of opening brackets in the first part is equal to number of closing brackets in the second part.
Input : str = "))"
Output: 2
Explanation: As after 2nd position i.e. )) and "empty" string will be split into these two parts: So, in this number of opening brackets i.e. 0 in the first part is equal to number of closing brackets in the second part i.e. also 0.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ str.size() â‰¤ 106
str consists of only '(' and ')' brackets.
